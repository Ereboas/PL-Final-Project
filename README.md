# PL-Final-Project
Implementation correctness of red-black tree insertion via VST

# Overview
main files:
* dependency/RTClosure.v: definitions and properties of reflexive transitive closure, from the course
* AuxiliaryTac.v: some tactics for automation in VST, from Instructor
* Tacs.v: some simple ltacs, for the convenience of proof
* definitions2.v: basic definitions, properties, equivalent forms and related lemmas of necessary predicates
* api_spec2.v: proof of called functions of "insert" or "insert_balance"
* verif_insert_balance.v: proof of "insert_balance"
* verif_insert.v: proof of "insert"

- rbt_insert2.c: C program to be proved
- rbt_insert2.v: the .v file generated by Clightgen

# Compilation Order
* Tacs.v -> AuxiliaryTac.v -> rbt_insert2.v -> definitions2.v -> api_spec2.v -> verif_insert_balance.v -> verif_insert.v
